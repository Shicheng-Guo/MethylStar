MethylStar performs methylation state calling using METHimpute, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based imputation algorithm that enables the construction of complete methylomes irrespective of sequencing depths or coverage.

In addition to cytosine-resolution calls, MethylStar offers options for converting METHimpute output files for input into DMR callers such as Methylkit and DMRcaller.

METHimpute output can also be converted to bigwig format for visualization using JBROWSE.
